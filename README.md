# Stochastic Processes 
some exercise for stochastic processes course

### 1. Box-Muller method to create normally distributed data
The aim of this exercise is to work with randomly generated data sets. First weâ€™re going to generate series of random numbers that are uniformly distributed. Then Box-Muller method is used to create normally distributed dataset from them. Probability distribution function p(x) for both of these datasets is constructed afterwards. In every case a normal graph and logarithmic graph with error bars are included. Finally we plot x^n p(x) versus x for different n values .
